# Thoughtful instructional design reduces learners’ cognitive load in computing

Cognitive load theory (CLT) is not a new idea, in that the challenges associated with designing effective teaching within the limit of working memory have been studied over the last two decades.[^1][^2] Whilst the theory isn’t universally established, it has been applied in many settings, and offers some important insights for computing educators.

## A model of cognition
Cognitive load theory builds on the idea that human memory has two distinct
areas, our short-term working memory and long-term memory. Whilst our
long-term memory can be seen as essentially infinite, our working memory is
extremely limited, with studies suggesting a processing capacity of between
three and nine “information elements”. This capacity can easily become
overloaded, impacting on our ability to process the information that we’re
presented with.

As we learn from our experiences, new information is stored in our long-term
memory for future recall. Over time, these disparate elements of information
are connected with existing understanding into collections of related knowledge
or schemas.

The goal of effective learning design should therefore be to facilitate the
movement of new ideas and information from working memory into conceptually sound schemas.
